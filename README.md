# Movie-Recommendation-System

- First I did some EDA on the data set.And after I got the necessary data I did some tasks in different columns on the dataset.
- After collecting only important data from every column , concatenate this column and make a new column “tags” .
- Finally vectorize them and create a function for recommending movies.And it will recommend 5 movies, which is closest  similar to called movie.
