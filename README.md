# Movie-Recommendation-System

•	TMDB 5000 Movie Datasets were used to make the recommendation system. This project was completed using python and some libraries like pandas and sci kit learn.

•	To get better accuracy, I combine 'credits' and 'movies' dataset. Then I did some EDA to get clean and valuable data. 

•	And vectorize them to measure the distance of one movie to another movie. Finally, create a function to recommend movies through this vector.
