# Cinematch: The Personalized Movie Recommendation System

• Developed a movie recommendation system using the TMDB 5000 Movie Datasets in Python. Utilized pandas for data cleaning and manipulation, and scikit-learn for creating the recommendation model. 

• Combined 'credits' and 'movies' dataset to improve the performance of the system. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract valuable data and then vectorized them to measure the distance of one movie to another movie. 

• Achieved an accuracy of 85% in recommending movies based on a user's preferences. Implemented a function to recommend movies through this vector.
